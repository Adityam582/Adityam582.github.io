* Study: I'm a multi-disciplinary person. I completed Bachelors of Engineering with honors in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from [Shree Vaishnav Institute of Technology and Science, Indore - India](https://svvv.edu.in/). However, I did not get spark to stay in electronics field, instead I was always more interested with computers. The concepts learnt from the field of electronics were certainly useful to understand and apply concepts in computer science. So ya, I switched from Electronics to Computer Science field.

I'm a M.Sc. student in Web & Data Science at the [University of Koblenz, Germany](https://west.uni-koblenz.de/studying/mwds). My masters is focused on the Web, Data Science, and Information Retrieval. I gained foundational knowledge about various topics from the fields as Web, Technology, Business and Society. 

Major subjects:
Data Science, Machine Learning, Game Theory, Network Theory and Python Programming
Practical Exposure:
Tableau, Power BI, SQL, HTML, CSS, RDF, and OWL 

My Master thesis is "Leveraging graph representation (deep) learning for software engineering", under [Prof. Dr. Ralf Laemmel](http://www.softlang.org/rlaemmel:home) and [Johannes Haertel](http://www.softlang.org/johanneshaertel:home), as part of Software Languages research group.



* Work: I've worked and excelled in wide range of tasks and roles. 


Anything interesting?
=====

Itâ€™s been more than 2 years I have actively used the social media accounts to focus on my learning and thinking process, to make my time follow my values.

I created, and still manage community server for University of Koblenz Web & Data science students, hosted on [Discord](). This is actively used by more than 150 students (precisely 177) to collaborate and to share useful information among students community. 



Favorite Quotes
=====

Future?
======

Well, with all entropy (uncertainties), I'm not really sure. I'm trying to find a way to do impactful work in the AI field as the top priority. I also see myself as a global citizen, hopping among Germany, Finland and other European countries - to wander and gain experiences, then finally to go back to India and stay with my family.
