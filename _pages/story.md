<!-- What do I do?
======
* Learn: Constant self-initiated learner: a believer, creator, and user of mental models. In my free time, I also generally enjoy working on side projects to make my own life easier. Specifically, I'm working to create comprehensive knowledge base of my life.

* Study: I'm a multi-disciplinary person. I completed Bachelors of Engineering in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from [Shree Vaishnav Institute of Technology and Science, Indore - India](https://svvv.edu.in/). However, I did not get spark to stay in electronics field, instead I was always more interested with computers. The concepts learnt from the field of electronics were certainly useful to understand and apply concepts in computer science. So ya, I switched from Electronics to Computer Science field. Currently, I'm a M.Sc. student in Web & Data Science at the [University of Koblenz, Germany](https://west.uni-koblenz.de/studying/mwds). My masters is focused on the Web, Data Science, and Information Retrieval. I gained foundational knowledge about various topics from the fields as Web, Technology, Business and Society. 

My Master thesis is "Leveraging graph representation (deep) learning for software engineering", under [Prof. Dr. Ralf Laemmel](http://www.softlang.org/rlaemmel:home) and [Johannes Haertel](http://www.softlang.org/johanneshaertel:home), as part of Software Languages research group.



* Work: I've worked and excelled in wide range of tasks and roles.  -->

<!-- * Itâ€™s been more than 3 years I have rarely used social media accounts to focus on my learning and thinking process, to make my time follow my values. -->

Future?
======

Well, with all entropy (uncertainties), I'm not really sure. I'm trying to find a way to do impactful work in the AI field as the top priority. I also see myself as a global citizen, hopping among Germany, Finland and other European countries - to wander and gain experiences, then finally to go back to India and stay with my family.
