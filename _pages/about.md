<!-- About Aditya -->
<!-- ====== -->
üôè Welcome, Greetings üëã, I'm Aditya Mehta (pronounced Aa-Di-T-Ya Me-h-Ta). 

I love to use the power of data, artificial intelligence & cloud to help humans take better decisions.

<!-- I love to explore using technologies to help humans capture, transfer and implement ideas in real world. -->

One of my Ex-boss (a SVP at Citibank Inc) gave me the title of "curious kid".

I can communicate in _Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Markdown, TeX_, and _Hindi, English, German_. 

I single-task, do deep work (hybrid mode), use Firefox browser, think long-term and future-focused.

In my free time, I wander a lot, mostly inside the world of books, or on a walk in nature.


<!-- By no means, I'm perfect and try to be less-erroneous. I enjoy solving problems and save time using technology, reducing entropy, and then serially over-thinking.  -->

<!-- My main tools are the Vim text editor, OpenBSD operating system, PostgreSQL database, Ruby language, and Firefox browser.  -->


Contact?

<!-- If you got interested in talking more about experiences, education, opportunities, or just hangout,I'd love to have a conversation because I believe:  -->
