Welcome to my tiny space on the internet! (Last updated: June 26, 2022)


Who am I?
======
Greetings 👋, I'm Aditya Mehta (pronounced Aa-Di-T-Ya Me-h-Ta), and I'm a data-driven AI and cloud practitioner. 

I am passionate to use the power of data and artificial intelligence to help humans take better decisions.

I love to explore using technologies to help humans capture, transfer and implement ideas in real world.

One of my Ex-boss (a SVP at Citibank Inc) gave me the title of "curious kid".

I single-task, do deep work, think long-term and future-focused.

I believe in hybrid work.

I am fluent in Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Markdown, TeX. I use Firefox browser.

In my free time, I let myself wander a lot, mostly inside the world of books, or on a walk in nature.

I can describe myself as a inquisitive communicator, incomplete explorer, lifelong student and life architect by reducing entropy. 
<!-- By no means, I'm perfect and try to be less-erroneous. I enjoy solving problems and save time using technology, reducing entropy, and then serially over-thinking.  -->

<!-- My main tools are the Vim text editor, OpenBSD operating system, PostgreSQL database, Ruby language, and Firefox browser.  -->


What do I do?
======
* Learn: Constant self-initiated learner: a believer, creator, and user of mental models. In my free time, I also generally enjoy working on side projects to make my own life easier. Specifically, I'm working to create comprehensive knowledge base of my life.

* Study: I'm a multi-disciplinary person. I completed Bachelors of Engineering with honors in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from [Shree Vaishnav Institute of Technology and Science, Indore - India](https://svvv.edu.in/). However, I did not get spark to stay in electronics field, instead I was always more interested with computers. The concepts learnt from the field of electronics were certainly useful to understand and apply concepts in computer science. So ya, I switched from Electronics to Computer Science field.

I'm a M.Sc. student in Web & Data Science at the [University of Koblenz, Germany](https://west.uni-koblenz.de/studying/mwds). My masters is focused on the Web, Data Science, and Information Retrieval. I gained foundational knowledge about various topics from the fields as Web, Technology, Business and Society. 

Major subjects:
Data Science, Machine Learning, Game Theory, Network Theory and Python Programming
Practical Exposure:
Tableau, Power BI, SQL, HTML, CSS, RDF, and OWL 

My Master thesis is "Leveraging graph representation (deep) learning for software engineering", under [Prof. Dr. Ralf Laemmel](http://www.softlang.org/rlaemmel:home) and [Johannes Haertel](http://www.softlang.org/johanneshaertel:home), as part of Software Languages research group.



* Work: I've worked and excelled in wide range of tasks and roles. 

Anything interesting?
=====

It’s been more than 2 years I have actively used the social media accounts to focus on my learning and thinking process, to make my time follow my values.

I created, and still manage community server for University of Koblenz Web & Data science students, hosted on [Discord](). This is actively used by more than 150 students (precisely 177) to collaborate and to share useful information among students community. 









Future?
======

Well, with all entropy (uncertainties), I'm not really sure. I'm trying to find a way to do impactful work in the AI field as the top priority. I also see myself as a global citizen, hopping among Germany, Finland and other European countries - to wander and gain experiences, then finally to go back to India and stay with my family.



Contact?

If you got interested in talking more about experiences, education, opportunities, or just hangout, feel free to connect on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eradityamehta). I'd love to have a conversation because I believe: 'every person I meet has a story, and experiences, which can teach me something new'.
