Hey there, I'm Aditya Mehta | आदित्य मेहता (pronounced Aa-Di-T-Ya Me-h-Ta). 

I'm a M.Sc. student at the [University of Koblenz, Germany](https://west.uni-koblenz.de/studying/mwds) in Web & Data Science.  

I can describe myself as a inquisitive, serial overthinker, intellectual wanderlust, communicator,  architect of life, incomplete explorer, and lifelong student. By no means, I'm perfect and try to be less-flawed. I enjoy solving problems and save time using technology, reducing entropy, and then over-thinking.
