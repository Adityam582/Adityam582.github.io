Welcome to my tiny space on the internet!

Who am I?
======
Greetings ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aditya Mehta (pronounced Aa-Di-T-Ya Me-h-Ta), and I'm a data-driven AI and cloud practitioner. 
I was born and raised in [Ujjain, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ujjain). 
I am currently living in [Koblenz, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koblenz).

I can describe myself as a inquisitive communicator, incomplete explorer, life architect, and lifelong student. By no means, I'm perfect and try to be less-erroneous. I enjoy solving problems and save time using technology, reducing entropy, and then serially over-thinking. 

I am fluent in Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Markdown, LaTex.

I have experience with all phases of the software lifecycle, from design, analysis and planning to deployment in production, and even maintenance of software.

I love to explore to use technologies for the benefits of human and transfer ideas in real world.


What do I do?
======
* Learn: Constant self-initiated learner: a believer, creator, and user of mental models. In my free time, I also generally enjoy working on side projects to make my own life easier. Specifically, I'm working to create comprehensive knowledge base of my life.

* Study: I'm a multi-disciplinary person. I completed Bachelors of Engineering with honors in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from [Shree Vaishnav Institute of Technology and Science](https://svvv.edu.in/). However, I did not get spark to stay in electronics field, instead I was always more interested with computers. The concepts learnt from the field of electronics were certainly useful to understand and apply concepts in computer science. So ya, I switched from Electronics to Computer Science field.

I'm a M.Sc. student in Web & Data Science at the [University of Koblenz, Germany](https://west.uni-koblenz.de/studying/mwds). My masters is focused on the Web, Data Science, and Information Retrieval. I gained foundational knowledge about various topics from the fields as Web, Technology, Business and Society. 

Major subjects:
Data Science, Machine Learning, Game Theory, Network Theory and Python Programming
Practical Exposure:
Tableau, Power BI, SQL, HTML, CSS, RDF, and OWL 

My Master thesis is "Leveraging graph representation (deep) learning for software engineering", under [Prof. Dr. Laemmel](http://www.softlang.org/rlaemmel:home) and [Johannes Haertel](http://www.softlang.org/johanneshaertel:home), as part of Software Languages research group.



* Work: I've worked and excelled in wide range of tasks and roles. 

Anything interesting?
=====

Itâ€™s been more than 2 years I have actively used the social media accounts to focus on my learning and thinking process, to make my time follow my values.
