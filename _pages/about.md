Welcome to my tiny space on the internet! (Last updated: June 21, 2022)


Who am I?
======
Greetings ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aditya Mehta (pronounced Aa-Di-T-Ya Me-h-Ta), and I'm a data-driven AI and cloud practitioner. 

I was born and raised in [Ujjain, India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ujjain). 

I am currently living in [Koblenz, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koblenz).

I am passionate to use the power of data to help humans take better decisions.

I love to explore using technologies to help humans capture, transfer and implement ideas in real world.

I am fluent in Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, Markdown, LaTex.

I have experience with all phases of the software lifecycle, from design, analysis and planning to deployment in production, and even maintenance of software.

I can describe myself as a inquisitive communicator, incomplete explorer, life architect, and lifelong student. By no means, I'm perfect and try to be less-erroneous. I enjoy solving problems and save time using technology, reducing entropy, and then serially over-thinking.

Personal Mission Statement
=====

I would like to engage in focused deep work. I would do these things everyday: read, write, think, meditate, walk. I will build and maintain delightful relationships with family and friends. I will learn a lot to create an impact by making a difference.



Hobbies and Interests
======
* Reading
* Intelligence (Human and artificial), data science, machine learning, networks and graph theory
* Travelling
* Attention economy, deep work, productivity
* Investments (time and money)
* Learning, unlearning and relearning constantly
* Deep one-to-one conversations
* Hinduism
* Spiritualism
* Indian Culture
* Roaming around on internet to find inspirational CVs, personal home page website designs



What do I do?
======
* Learn: Constant self-initiated learner: a believer, creator, and user of mental models. In my free time, I also generally enjoy working on side projects to make my own life easier. Specifically, I'm working to create comprehensive knowledge base of my life.

* Study: I'm a multi-disciplinary person. I completed Bachelors of Engineering with honors in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from [Shree Vaishnav Institute of Technology and Science](https://svvv.edu.in/). However, I did not get spark to stay in electronics field, instead I was always more interested with computers. The concepts learnt from the field of electronics were certainly useful to understand and apply concepts in computer science. So ya, I switched from Electronics to Computer Science field.

I'm a M.Sc. student in Web & Data Science at the [University of Koblenz, Germany](https://west.uni-koblenz.de/studying/mwds). My masters is focused on the Web, Data Science, and Information Retrieval. I gained foundational knowledge about various topics from the fields as Web, Technology, Business and Society. 

Major subjects:
Data Science, Machine Learning, Game Theory, Network Theory and Python Programming
Practical Exposure:
Tableau, Power BI, SQL, HTML, CSS, RDF, and OWL 

My Master thesis is "Leveraging graph representation (deep) learning for software engineering", under [Prof. Dr. Laemmel](http://www.softlang.org/rlaemmel:home) and [Johannes Haertel](http://www.softlang.org/johanneshaertel:home), as part of Software Languages research group.



* Work: I've worked and excelled in wide range of tasks and roles. 

Anything interesting?
=====

Itâ€™s been more than 2 years I have actively used the social media accounts to focus on my learning and thinking process, to make my time follow my values.

I created, and still manage community server for University of Koblenz Web & Data science students, hosted on [Discord](). This is actively used by more than 150 students (precisely 177) to collaborate and to share useful information among students community. 






What am I doing now (these days)?
=====

* Working on Master Thesis
* Solving practice questions to prepare for AWS SAA certification
* Teaching as a tutor for the course "Web Information Retrieval"
* Applying for relevant job opportunities

Future?
======

* Well, with all entropy (uncertainties), I'm not really sure. I'm trying to find a way to do impactful work in the AI field as the top priority. I also see myself as a global citizen, hopping among Germany, Finland and other European countries - to wander and gain experiences, then finally to go back to India and stay with my family.
