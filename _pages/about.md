Who am I?
======
Greetings ðŸ‘‹, I'm Aditya Mehta (pronounced Aa-Di-T-Ya Me-h-Ta). Although I was born and raised in Ujjain, India, however I am currently living in Koblenz, Germany.

I can describe myself as a inquisitive communicator, incomplete explorer, life architect, and lifelong student. By no means, I'm perfect and try to be less-erroneous. I enjoy solving problems and save time using technology, reducing entropy, and then serially over-thinking.

* Study: I'm a multi-disciplinary person. I completed Bachelors of Engineering with honors in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from [Shree Vaishnav Institute of Technology and Science](https://svvv.edu.in/). However, I did not get spark to stay in electronics field, instead I was always more interested with computers. The concepts learnt from the field of electronics were certainly useful to understand and apply concepts in computer science. So ya, I switched from Electronics to Computer Science field.

I'm a M.Sc. student in Web & Data Science at the [University of Koblenz, Germany](https://west.uni-koblenz.de/studying/mwds). My masters is focused on the Web, Data Science, and Information Retrieval. I gained foundational knowledge about various topics from the fields as Web, Technology, Business and Society. 

Major subjects:
Data Science, Machine Learning, Game Theory, Network Theory and Python Programming
Practical Exposure:
Tableau, Power BI, SQL, HTML, CSS, RDF, and OWL 

My Master thesis is "Leveraging graph representation (deep) learning for software engineering", under [Prof. Dr. Laemmel](http://www.softlang.org/rlaemmel:home) and [Johannes Haertel](http://www.softlang.org/johanneshaertel:home), as part of Software Languages research group.



* Work: I'm a professional with experience in application administration, production assurance, infrastructure management, development of innovative projects in cloud and machine learning. 

Timeline:
