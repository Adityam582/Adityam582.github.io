# Frequently Asked Questions 

## Pre-requisities to take AWS certifications

All certifications are independent of each other. You take take any of them directly. However, going with incremental improvements (foundational knowledge to advanced knowledge) is recommended.

## Which AWS certification should I get first? 

* If you are totally new to the AWS cloud, get started with the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner. 
  
  This gives you a broad introduction to the key AWS services and helps you understand how the AWS Cloud works.

* If you already have some experience with AWS, a great stepping stone towards the next level certification can be the AWS Solutions Architect Associate. 
  
  This gives a high-level overview and medium understanding of creating solutions architecting on AWS for various business needs.

## How to study and prepare?

Essential elements of trainings: 

•	Understanding of theory concepts

•	Practicing the exam questions

•	Recommended to do hands-on practical experience

### Options

1. AWS Trainings

2. YouTube videos

3. Dedicated course on Udemy/other online platforms

* Although one may tend to go for free options such as on AWS website, or YouTube videos to learn theory concepts. However, the most efficient way is to do it through a dedicated course, which is usually paid. For example, [NEW Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner - 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/), or the ones from [Digital Cloud](https://digitalcloud.training/) as mentioned below. These options are really worth the money you pay for.

* Irrespective of whether you buy a paid course to learn theory concepts or you learn them for free, buying "practice exams" course is really heavily recommended and the most efficient way to crack the certificate.
