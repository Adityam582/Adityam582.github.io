# Frequently Asked Questions 

## Pre-requisities to take AWS certifications

All certifications are independent of each other. You take take any of them directly. However, going with incremental improvements (foundational knowledge to advanced knowledge) is recommended.

## Which AWS certification should I get first? 

* If you are totally new to the AWS cloud, get started with the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner. 
  
  This gives you a broad introduction to the key AWS services and helps you understand how the AWS Cloud works.

* If you already have some experience with AWS, a great stepping stone towards the next level certification can be the AWS Solutions Architect Associate. 
  
  This gives a high-level overview and medium understanding of creating solutions architecting on AWS for various business needs.

* For more details, please check AWS Certification [FAQ](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/faqs/?ch=sec&sec=faq). 

* Please check exam guides for specific certifications.

## How to study and prepare?

Essential elements of trainings: 

•	Understanding of concepts

•	Practicing the exam questions

•	Recommended to do hands-on practical experience (not absolutely necessary though)

### Options

1. AWS Trainings or AWS Skill Builder or through AWS Partner Networks (APNs)

2. YouTube videos

3. Dedicated course on Digital Cloud Training/Udemy/other online platforms

* Although one may tend to go for free options such as AWS website/APNs to learn concepts, however it's tedious and time-consuming. 
* The most efficient way is to do it through a dedicated course, which is usually paid. For example, [NEW Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner - 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/) basically the content from Stephane Maarek, or the ones from [Digital Cloud](https://digitalcloud.training/). These options are really worth the money you pay for.

* Irrespective of whether you buy a paid course to learn theory concepts or you learn them for free, buying "practice exams" course is really heavily recommended and the most efficient way to crack the certificate.

# My AWS Certifications Journey

## AWS Cloud Practitioner (AWS CCP)

I started with AWS Cloud Practitioner certificate first. I prepared on my own through 
[Digital Cloud AWS CCP](https://digitalcloud.training/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/) ultimate training package, and wrote the exam.

### Steps of learning

•	**Theory**: Understanding theory concepts by watching video tutorial course 

•	**Practice**: Practicing exam questions by doing practice exam course

•	**Hands-on**: I was already working on AWS in my previous project, so did not do hands-on separately.

**Time spent**: about two weeks for understanding concepts, two weeks for practicing exam questions.

**Certification passed**: 13 Dec 2021

### My recommendation

1. Understanding concepts: Watch the full video on YouTube (you may like to install a good ad-blocker):

* Basic Introduction: [ AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Training 2020 - Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hLmDS179YE)

* Deep Dive: [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOTamWNgDKc)

* Do make notes, however not too much detailed. 

2. Practice questions: 

* Get this course [AWS CCP DCT Practice Exams](https://digitalcloud.training/courses/aws-ccp-practice-exams/)

  Logical flow of practice (step-wise): Do questions from 
  1. Practice Exams – Knowledge Review 
  2. Practice Exams – Training Mode
  3. Practice Exams – Exam Mode
  4. Final exam simulator

* Don't take too much detailed notes. Do note down why some specific option is right or wrong.

## AWS Solutions Architect Associate (AWS SAA)

Next, I continued with AWS Solutions Architect Associate certificate. I prepared through 
[Digital Cloud AWS SAA](https://digitalcloud.training/aws-certified-solutions-architect-associate/) ultimate training package, and wrote the exam.

### Steps of learning

•	**Theory**: Understanding concepts by watching video tutorial course

•	**Practice**: Practicing exam questions by doing practice exam course

•	**Hands-on**: I tried working with some but not all hands-on lessons in the course

**Time spent**: about six weeks for understanding concepts, two weeks for  practicing exam questions. 

**Certification passed**: 7 Dec 2022

### My recommendation

* Buying a dedicated course such as the one mentioned above is a good idea for AWS SAA. 
* Also, it's recommended though not absolutely necessary to do hands-on experiments to learn by doing.
* The logical flow of practice stays same as mentioned for AWS CCP.

## Reasons to do it this way

•	**Self-paced course**: The sessions can be spread over time which is good when learning a new thing. 

•	**Efficient**: It offers 500+ practice questions to practice for a confident preparation.

•	**Hands-On**: Opportunity to do practical hands-on exercises as well.

## Revision: using Mind maps

I used mind-maps to quickly revise various services.
  
* Do a quick search for "aws cloud practitioner mind map" or "aws solutions architect associate mind map". Look for images.
