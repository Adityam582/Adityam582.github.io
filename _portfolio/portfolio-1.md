# Data-driven Projects

1. NeuroAI: brain-tumor-classification (Deep Learning: Computer Vision)

* This is an end-to-end machine learning lifecycle project, when I started from picking the dataset up to deploying as a web application. This helped me learn various nuance of a ML project development. 

* This is a project, making computers to learn to predict, if an image contains traces of tumor. 

* Sounds interesting, want to try out yourself? Simply use any webpage and upload image.

**Skills:** Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, Streamlit

2. New York City Taxi Trip Data Analysis (Big Data: Data Analysis)

* The purpose of our project is to study and analyse traffic patterns and insights from the data obtained from a fleet of taxi operating in New York City. 

* With exploratory data analysis, we tried to implement some machine learning algorithm for prediction of fare amounts based on different features. 

* Use cases can be for **Traffic Optimization** and **Financial Analysis**.

**Technologies/Tools:** Spark on a distributed cluster with 4 servers, PySpark, SQL API, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
